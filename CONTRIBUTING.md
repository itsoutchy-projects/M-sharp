### Requirements:
1. Knowledge of C# (C-Sharp) as this language's interpreter is written in C#
2. An IDE (and knowledge of how to use it)
3. Git (To easilly clone your fork of the repo which you'll need to be able to start a pull request)
4. A Github account (to fork this repo)

## Start
### Ideas
There are lots of things which you may be able to help with such as:
- Some thing(s) in the TODO list on [README.md](README.md)
- Implementing more pre-defined functions
- Extra keywords (such as: `for`, `foreach`, etc *this is hard so only do this if you really want to*)
