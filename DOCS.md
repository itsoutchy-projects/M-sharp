## Pre-defined functions
`Reset` - Attempts to restart code execution **`THIS IS DANGEROUS!`**  
`PrintVars` - Prints all the found variables and their values  
`HelloWorld` - Prints "Hello world!"

## Custom variables `BETA`
To declare a variable, simply use the `var` keyword, followed by the name of it, then ` = ` followed by the value

## Custom Functions `BETA`
When creating a function, you must put the `function` keyword, then at the end of the function, you must put the `end` keyword  
`NOTE: I am unsure of whether indenting code is possible!`
