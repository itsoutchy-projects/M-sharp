# M#
M# is a language which intends to be a starting point for new programmers looking for a text-based language. It is interpreted, however, it's open source! Meaning you can modify it to how you wish!

For documentation see [this](DOCS.md)

## How can I use this?
There will be a compiled version shortly, but if you really want to use it now, then follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository and copy its url
2. If you haven't already, [download git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. Have [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs) installed
4. Run `git clone <url>`, replacing `<url>` with the url you copied earlier
5. Open the directory in Visual Studio
6. Press the play button near the top
7. Enter the path to an M# script into the window
8. Hit enter and see your code get run

## Questions
Q: Why does it print text when variables and functions get created?  
A: To help with debugging, so it's easier to find the source of any problems.

Q: What's with the low amount of things possible?
A: This language was started just recently, meaning I wouldn't have time to implement lots of functions.
